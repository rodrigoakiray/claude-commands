# Agent Instructions

Read `CLAUDE.md` in this directory and follow it in full before making any edit. It
is the single source of truth for all agents here; this file carries no rules of its
own beyond the Next.js compatibility block below, which `next dev`/`next build`
regenerate automatically — do not hand-edit it.

<!-- BEGIN:nextjs-agent-rules -->

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
